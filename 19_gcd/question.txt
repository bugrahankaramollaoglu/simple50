Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Write a function that finds the GCD of two numbers using Euclidean algorithm.

Example:
Input: a = 48, b = 18
Output: 6

Input: a = 54, b = 24
Output: 6

Input: a = 7, b = 13
Output: 1

Input: a = 0, b = 5
Output: 5

Note: GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without remainder.
