# simple50

this is a list of 50 fundamental data structures questions that I have collected in the last couple of years. it is comprised of the very foundations that a programmer needs for further questions.

## Folder Layout
```
01_strLen/            ─ Solution + question text
02_strCat/
...
50_fizzBuzz/
```
No external libraries or build tool is required—just the Java compiler.

## Requirements
* **JDK 8 or newer** (some solutions use `String.isBlank()` → JDK 11+).

## How to Compile & Run an Exercise
```bash
# example: run the rotate-array solution
cd 12_rotateArray
javac rotateArray.java   # produces rotateArray.class
java  rotateArray         # prints the demo output
```
Repeat for any other folder/file you want to test.
